# Statistical-Machine-Learning (Spring 2025)
Personal repository for coursework from CMU's Statistical Machine Learning course [36-662], taught by Pf. Spencer Koerner.

# Course Outline
This course helped me adopt a statistical perspective in three key areas:
1) Supervised Learning
   - Logistic regression, Regularization
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Kernels
   - Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests 
2) Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Multidimensional Scaling
3) Neural Networks and Deep Learning

# Learning Objectives 
1. Select appropriate methods and justify my choices
2. Implement methods programmatically using R and evaluate their performance
3. Explain results to a non-technical audience

# Assignments
Each assignment provided hands-on experience in:
- HW1: Best classification for asymmetric losses, Using regression to design classifiers
- HW2: Playing with separable data and visualizing decision boundaries 
- HW3: Regularization techniques and generalization
- HW4: LDA, Hinge loss and SVMs
- HW5: Non-linear feature maps, Kernels, Decision trees
- HW6: Boosting and Implementing AdaBoost
- HW7: PCA for Character Recognition
